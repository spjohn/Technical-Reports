# Technical-Reports
This includes the different lab experiments done in Python. Some of the codes for the experiments are included.If you are using the codes, do make the necessary changes with respect to input image given.

a1.py is the code to find the HOG feature vector of the given image.It was part of Labsheet 4.

a2.py is the code to find the affine transformation between two images and the corresponding points in the two images were selected manually.It was part of Labsheet 1.

opticalflow1.py and opticalflow2.py are codes to find the optical flow directions using Lucas-Kanade mathod (1) and Horn and Schunk method (2) respectively. The images OF1,OF2,OF11 and OF22 were used as inputs.
